This is an actual diary to keep track of my training at Git.
Remark: I haven't tried anything new since last week, so we'll see.
First problem: I didn't recall that I need to add a file in order to commit and push.
Second problem: I didn't remember that I used a token to upload changes to GitHub, this could be a (serious) problem.
